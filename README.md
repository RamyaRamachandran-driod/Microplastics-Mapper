# Microplastics-Mapper

This project represents the first GIS-based analytical tool (as of 2024) to map and predict microplastic concentrations across the Indian subcontinent and its coastal waters. By moving beyond sparse empirical sampling, the application visualizes microplastic density per square meter through a Random Forest Regressor.

The architecture synthesizes multi-modal data points, including live monitoring of ocean currents via GIS tools and historical plastic production metrics to validate and predict distribution across 100+ locations. Built with Python and React with datasets from the National Centers for Environmental Information, the system challenges conventional environmental assumptions by identifying significant divergences between literature-based proxies and empirical measurements.
